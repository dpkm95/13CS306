Semantic Analysis of a C program is done w.r.t the following requirements, semantic check of the function calls and semantic check of the parenthesis. To perform semantic check of the function calls, the C program is parsed and the corresponding function table and the variable table are created. Character Stack (parenthesis) is used to perform semantic check of the parenthesis.
